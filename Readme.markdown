AddCaptionToBingDyanmicTheme
----------------------------
Bing dynamic theme downloads images from Bing server using a RSS feed and displays them as desktop wallpaper in regular interval. Though images have info like image description, place taken and author, it not displayed in the image as they do it in National Geography channel's Photo a Day. This script extracts image meta info from tags and add it to the image. 

Software used:
1. Powershell. 
2. ImageMagic.
